## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-04
- No changes from `v0.2.0` but just bumping to final first major release version!

## [0.2.0] - 2021-07-04
- Using the `gem-release` gem extension to make release process easier.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-07-04
- First release version. The plugin is fully working but I suspect that there might be a few point releases just to nail the release process. Once this is working, there will soon be an 1.0.0 release!
